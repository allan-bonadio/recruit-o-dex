=========================================  start

You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using brew, or you can run MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system ulimit values automatically (see ulimit settings for more information).

To run MongoDB (i.e. the mongod process) as a macOS service, run:

brew services start mongodb-community@7.0

To stop a mongod running as a macOS service, use the following command as needed:

brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0

To run mongod manually as a background process using a config file, run:

For macOS running Intel processors:

mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork

For macOS running on
Apple Silicon processors:

mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf --fork



========================================= stop
To stop a mongod running as a background process, connect to the mongod using
mongosh
, and issue the shutdown command as needed.


========================================= macOS Prevents mongod From Opening
macOS may prevent mongod from running after installation. If you receive a security error when starting mongod indicating that the developer could not be identified or verified, do the following to grant mongod access to run:

Open System Preferences

Select the Security and Privacy pane.

Under the General tab, click the button to the right of the message about mongod, labelled either Open Anyway or Allow Anyway depending on your version of macOS.
